This function takes the sender's private key, the receiver's public key, and the amount to be transferred as input, and returns a transaction that is mixed with other transactions to obscure the sender's and receiver's identities. You can then use the `sign` function to sign the transaction with the sender's private key, and broadcast it to the network.\", \n\"example\": \"Here is an example of how to create a privacy-preserving transaction using ErgoMix in ErgoScript:\\n```\\nfrom ergoSDK import ergoMix\\n\\ndef create_privacy_preserving_transaction(sender_private_key, receiver_public_key, amount):\\n    transaction = ergoMix(sender_private_key, receiver_public_key, amount)\\n    return transaction\\n\\n```\\nThis function takes the sender's private key, the receiver's public key, and the amount to be transferred as input, and returns a transaction that is mixed with other transactions to obscure the sender's and receiver's identities.\", \n\"source\": \"https://docs.ergoplatform.org/en/latest/developer-guide/ergomix.html\" \n} \n```\n\nThis response provides a step-by-step guide on how to create a privacy-preserving transaction using ErgoMix, including the necessary function calls and parameters.

The research team is collecting data from various sources, including historical documents, newspapers, and oral interviews with local residents. The analysis of the data is being carried out in order to identify the main factors that have shaped the history of the city, such as the influence of different cultures, the impact of political events, and the role of the city in the development of the country. The results of the research will be presented in a series of articles, which will be published in a special issue of the journal \\\"Georgian Studies\\\". The second phase of the project involves the creation of a virtual museum of the history of Tbilisi, which will be a web-based platform that will provide access to the data collected during the research. The virtual museum will include a database of historical events, a collection of images and documents, and a section for oral interviews with local residents. The platform will be designed to be user-friendly and will allow visitors to explore the history of the city in a interactive way. The third phase of the project involves the creation of a series of educational materials, such as textbooks, guides, and multimedia presentations, which will be based on the research results and will be used in schools and educational institutions. The materials will be designed to be engaging and interactive, and will provide students with a deeper understanding of the history of the city and its significance in the development of the country.
